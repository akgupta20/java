There is no concept of pointers in java.

Reference Data Type: 
String, Array, Class, Interface(Defines Blueprint of the class)

String literal => String greeting = 'Hello'; # Hello is the string literal

String greeting = "Hello";  // "Hello" is the string literal
✅ Use double quotes for String literals in Java, not single quotes (')—those are for char.

public
static
final => used for const variable



To pass data as a reference use Reference classes(Wrapper class over primitive value).

Integer,Character, Long, String, ArrayList...

Integer a = 10; 

int b = 20;

Integer c = a ; // Auto-Boxing

int d = a; // Unboxing

# Ways to declare Array in Java
int arr[] = {};

int []arr = {};

Reference type object is declared in the heap memory.
